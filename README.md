### :wave: Hi, I'm Alyse Peak

I'm a technical writer with over four years of experience creating user-centered content. I'm extra passionate about cloud, DevOps, and instructional content, but my experience spans across:

:computer: **EdTech**: I copyedited instructional content for cloud and DevOps courses, and created lab guides to step students through hands-on learning objectives. 

:credit_card: **Cyberfraud Prevention**: I updated and maintained content within an internal knowledge base for the Customer Success team, worked with Marketing to create customer-facing support documentation, and assisted with QA by performing exploratory and regression testing. 

:clipboard: **InsurTech**: I updated a full internal knowledge base for insurance software and procedures, which contained over 90 articles.

:slot_machine: **FinTech/Gaming**: I authored dozens of short-form instructions for slot gameplay configurations and casino kiosk software, as well as a few long-form manuals for kiosk hardware. 

:hospital: **HealthTech**: I created procedural infographics, quick-reference pages, and release notes for a clinical trial management software.
